LA-Strings is distributed with the text versions of the language
models rather than the binary databases.  Three
language-identification databases and two character-set-identification
databases can be built from these models by running the included
makefile.  Only the default databases, 'languages.db' and
'charsets.db', are built by the default make target; to build all of
them, use 'make all', or explicitly build each of the alternate
databases with 'make crubadan.db', 'make top100.db', or 'make
top100-charsets.db'.
