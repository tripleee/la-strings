v1.24 2014-08-19:
   Improved n-gram weighting for language identification yields ~3%
     relative reduction in classification errors in preliminary
     testing.
   Improved byte-based subsampling in 'subsample' results in much more
     accurate size of result.  Eliminated subsample.C dependencies
     on FramepaC to allow standalone distribution.
   Added option to MkLangID to perform frequency smoothing using
     a logarithmic mapping rather than P^y mapping; specify a
     negative smoothing value for -S to activate.
   Boosted model size for a small number of highly-confusible
     language sets to 15000 n-grams for better discrimination.
   Added --yali flag to eval.sh and counts.sh to support use of
     Majlis's Yet Another Language Identifier as language
     identification program in evaluations.
   Fixed some compiler warnings for GCC 4.3.2 and 4.8.

     en_GB to complement the existing en_US models; US versus British
     will be displayed when using options that show the region as well
     as the language code (e.g. the default for 'whatlang').

     pairs=4466+5, total encodings=38]

v1.23 2013-08-28:
   Added missing initializations to scan_strings so that
     bulk_extractor plugin extracts the same strings as the standalone
     version.  Fixed multi-threading crash.
   Added setlocale("en_US.UTF-8") for systems on which
     setlocale("UTF-8") fails.
   Added --batch flag to eval.sh to run all identifications in a
     single invocation of the identification program, to avoid startup
     overhead (particularly for LangDetect and langid.py).  Added
     util/score.C to perform bulk scoring on batch-mode identification
     output.
   Fixed eval.sh line-counting with --utf16be and --utf16le.

     --utf16be and --utf16le.  Fixed bug in mklangid when building
     UTF16 models without using -2b/-2l/-8b/-8l.
   MkLangID was not correctly filtering ngrams for ASCII-16BE and
     UTF-16BE, because the deciding byte of the second character is
     the fourth byte of the ngram, and the filtering took place at the
     trigram-counting stage.
   Added make targets for language databases omitting UTF16 models.
     Modified build process to eliminate warnings for "top100" databases.
   Added several missing UTF16 models. Added romanized Hindi language

v1.21 2013-05-31:
   Added -16b/-16l flags to 'whatlang' to permit input of UTF16BE and
     UTF16LE text in line-by-line mode (echoed text is converted to
     UTF8).  Upgraded evaluation scripts to support testing of UTF16
     language identification from UTF8 test/key files with new
     --utf16be and --utf16le flags.
   Added -l and -L flags to langident/subsample to sample lines by
     length in bytes, and -b flag to sample uniformly with a target
     size in bytes instead of number of lines

     MkLangID to convert a language database into another database
     containing a smaller number of models merged from the models in
     the original database (initially a single model for each distinct
     character encoding).  This nearly doubles la-strings throughput
     on random data with language identification for the full

   Added -W option to la-strings and langident/whatlang to permit the
     weights of bigrams and stopgrams to be set from the commandline.
     Adjusted default weights based on experiments with full test set.
     MkLangID's -n flag no longer eliminates trigrams starting with a
     blank, only those starting with two blanks.
   Modified n-gram weighting to cut error rates by 1/4 to 1/3 and
     optimized inner loop of language identifier, reducing its overall
     runtime by 45%.
   Added language models for Adyghe [Russia], Altai [Russia],
     Asheninka Pajonal [Peru], Blackfoot [Canada], Buhid
     [Philippines], Dakota [US], Djambarrpuyngu [Australia], San Luis

     pairs=3016+2]

v1.13 2012-02-29:
   Added -C option to la-strings to print counts of the number of
     strings in each language that were extracted; may be combined
     with -I0 to show only the totals rather than printing the
     identified language for each string.
   Added util/icuconv.C to convert character sets to/from UTF-8 using
     libicu (International Components for Unicode) and util/icutrans.C
     as a trivial front-end to the libicu romanization functions.
   Added util/mktestset.sh and util/eval.sh to generate and evaluate
     single-language test sets from held-out data, and
     util/interleave.c to generate a multi-language test set.
   Tweaked inter-string smoothing function in la-strings language
     identification.  Added -b2 option to langident/whatlang to apply
     same smoothing to its per-line language identification.
   Based on large-scale experiments, bumped maximum length back up to
     6/8 and top-k to 3000/4000 (single/multi-byte characters).
     Performance starts to degrade for longer n-grams, while
     performance asymptotically improves as top-k increases.
   Corrected the training of ASCII-16 and UTF-16 models for many of
     the languages added prior to v1.10 to use the settings for
     multi-byte scripts instead of single-byte scripts.  Added missing
     -A2 flag for a number of other 16-bit models.

     pairs=2908+2]

v1.12 2012-01-08:
   Eliminate singleton bigrams from language models as they take up
     space in the database while not contributing to scoring.
   Based on additional experimentation, reduced maximum n-gram length
     to 5/8 for single/multi-byte texts and n-gram count to 2500 for
     most languages and 4000 for a few (mostly CJK languages), which
     reduced the language database size by a further factor of three.
   Implemented -L flag to MkLangID to limit training to first N bytes
     of the input data, enabling ablation experiments.
   Added 'langident/subsample' program to permit holding out a portion
     of the language training data for testing.
   Added optional build target 'top100.db' to build a database of the
     top 100 languages by first-language speakers (according to
     Ethnologue), plus a few official EU languages that don't quite
     make the top 100.
   Added language models built from Bible translations for Awadhi

     of the need for external conversions during training.
   Augmented la-strings -O flag with optional directory name for the
     location in which to store extracted strings.
   Corrected handling of string extraction from standard input so that
     data can now be piped into la-strings
   Tweaked relative weights of language-identification score and other
     factors in computing overall confidence score for a string.
   Tweaked character-encoding detection threshold to reduce false
     positives.
   Improved ability to distinguish between big- and little-endian
     16-bit strings, especially 16-bit ASCII that was previously
     displayed as Chinese characters.
   Added more discriminative training using similarity scores to
     automatically select contrastive languages.

   Fixed unpacking of packed trie for use by MkLangID.
   Fixed major memory leaks in MkLangID, reducing its memory
     requirements by a factor of three.
   Added aligned-matching option, so that ngrams may be restricted to
     start at a multiple of 2 or 4 bytes from the start of the file
     (in training) or start of the candidate string.  Alignment is
     selected with the new -A flag to MkLangID or via the new
     Alignment: directive in *.lid files.   
   Added -E flag to la-strings to display the encoding used to extract
     each string.
   Implemented cosine-similarity scoring between languages in a
     database.  Augmented the MkLangID -R option to allow automatic
     selection of discriminative-training languages based on cosine
     value relative to the language being trained.
   Tweaked character-set detection threshold to better find short
     strings of e.g. UTF16 embedded inside longer stretches of
     ASCII16.  Tweaked scoring of strings to avoid confusion between
     UTF-8 and Latin-1/Windows-1252 encodings.
   Incorporated language-identification scores into confidence score
     for each extracted string.  As this rendered the old
     character-bigram language models obsolete, removed the relevant
     code for bigram models (-b option, 'mkbigram' program, etc.).
   Rebuilt ASCII-16LE, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE models with two-byte
     alignment.
   Added ASCII-16BE models for Afrikaans, Albanian, Alsatian, Bavarian

v1.08 2011-11-29:
   Generate bigram counts from trigram count table *before* filtering
     out trigrams which are not language-indicative (e.g. digit
     strings).
   Tweaked character-encoding identification scan.
   Precompute model-number-to-character-set mapping to speed up
     automatic character set identification.  Additional performance
     optimizations resulted in an overall 45% speed-up in language
     identification.
   Fixed memory leak.  Fixed crash when NOT using language
     identification.
   Modified database format for a further 20% reduction in size (35%
     for crubadan.db) with negligible increase in runtime.  Databases
     created with version 1.07 are still readable.
   Rebuilt Afrikaans, Dutch, Limburgian, and Low_Saxon models with
     mutual discriminative training.  Fixed Waray-Waray model.
   [languages.db: total languages=211+3, total models=566+3, lang/code
     pairs=512+3]

v1.07 2011-11-17:
   Implemented a new file format for the language identification
     database which requires 55% less space and reduces runtime by 15%
     due to improved spatial locality.  Because the new format is not
     incrementally updateable, implemented conversion to and from the
     old format for internal use in MkLangID.  Note that
     identification may differ marginally due to a reduction in the
     number of bits used to store each probability.
   Language identification database is now memory mapped, allowing
     multiple instances of the code to share memory.
   Moved romanization code down into langident library and added a
     standalone romanization program 'romanize'.
   Added ISO 9984 romanization for Georgian, ISO 9985 romanization for
     Armenian, ISO 11940 romanization for Thai, and modified ISO 15919
     romanization for Devanagari / Indic scripts.   Augmented ISO 843
     romanization with Extended Greek Unicode codepoints.
   Added Pennsylvania Dutch language model trained from posts at
     hiwwewiedriwwe.wordpress.com.
   Added language models for romanized Arabic and Greek.

     selection of the encoding when most of the text is in the 7-bit
     ASCII range.  Rebuilt various other closely-related languages
     with stop-grams.
   Added sample test texts taken from the front pages of various
     language versions of Wikipedia and a script to combine them
     into a single file which intersperses random binary data between

     Latin-1), Volapuk (UTF-8 and Latin-1), and West Frisian (UTF-8
     and Latin-1) models based on text from Wikipedia.  
   Added ITRANS-romanized Sanskrit (ASCII) model.
   Added UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE models converted from UTF-8 with iconv
     for Armenian, Azeri, Northern Azeri, Belarusan, Cherokee, Coptic,

     Kurdish, Malayalam, Myanmar, Pashto, Serbian, Tatar, Thai, and
     Urdu. Rebuilt existing models to include long language name. 
   Added Code Page 737 (Greek) to supported character sets.
   [languages.db: total languages=142+18, total models=336+18]

     (UTF-8), Uma [Indonesia] (ASCII), Uspanteco (ASCII), and
     Cyrillic-script Uzbek (UTF-8 and Windows-1251) language models
     built from Bible text.
   Added Scots Gaelic (UTF8 and Latin-1) built from web text.
   Removed faked Cherokee language model.
   Fixed Ukrainian (KOI8-U) model, which incorrectly flagged its
     encoding as KOI8-R, resulting in heavily segmented extraction. 
   Added ASCII-32BE and ASCII-32LE character sets to correspond
     exactly to the GNU strings 'B' and 'L' encodings, which was not
     the case with the UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE for which those were
     previously the short names.
   Updated Windows-1256 character table to avoid fragmenting Arabic
     texts.
   Added -fc flag to MkLangID to support trigram statistics files from
     the Crubadan project.  Added processed version of Crubadan
     trigram data package to generate crubadan.db database with 452
     models covering 437 languages (note that except for a few that
     were converted to Latin-1, all models use the UTF-8 encoding).
     Added Bicolano, Fijian, Frisian, Ilocano, Javanese, Kalaallisut,
     Kurdi, Maltese, Malay, Norwegian Bokmal, Oromo, Papiamentu,
     Samoan, Sunda, Tajiki, Tibetan, Tongan, Tok Pisin, Venda,
     Walloon, and Western Farsi models to default languages.db build,
     as these are the Crubadan languages with the highest trigram
     counts for which there were not yet real language models.
     Removed faked Javanese and Tibetan models.
   [languages.db: total languages=127+21, total models=262+24]

v1.01 2011-08-31:
   Added "whole-file" mode to 'whatlang', where it reads at most 1MB
     of the file and outputs a single set of guesses based on that
     text.  Use -b0 to select this mode.
   Added -u flag to la-strings to use libiconv to convert extracted
     text to Unicode for ease of reading results when multiple
     character sets are present in the input.  The trivial conversions
     for Latin-1, ASCII-16, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are available even if
     libiconv is not available on the compilation platform.
   Added UTF8: directive in frequency lists given to MkLangID to
     define fake language models consisting of just the UTF-8
     codepoints which are valid for a particular script.  Added faked
     language models for Aramaic, Balinese, Batak, Bengali, Buginese,
     Cherokee, Gujarati, Javanese, Khmer, Lao, Sinhala, and Tibetan.
   Added numerous translations of the Bible as language models:

     Irish Gaelic (UTF-8 and Latin-1) Kabyle [Algeria] (UTF-8),
     Kannada (UTF-8, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE), Kyrgyz (UTF-8, UTF-16BE,
     and UTF-16LE), Latin (ASCII), Latvian (UTF-8 and Latin-2),

     (Windows-1256) models, converted with iconv.  Added Hindi (ISCII)
     model converted with Gnu Emacs.

v1.00 2011-08-26:
   la-strings now appends a question mark to identified languages when
     confidence is low.  Smoothing method changed to exponential decay
     because it works at least as well but is faster and simpler.
   Changed default number of languages displayed (-I flag) to 2.
   Added -nn flag to MkLangID to skip n-grams starting with two digits
     as well as n-grams containing newlines, as strings of digits are
     not informative for language identification.
   Tweaked definition of CP866 character set and added RUSCII variant.
     Added CP915 and CP28595 as aliases for ISO-8859-5.  Made
     ISO-8859-7 a specificaly supported character set instead of an
     alias for 8859-6.
   Corrected suffix filtering to remove an n-gram even if there are
     multiple continuations in the training data, as long as the most
     frequent one occurs in at least the proportion specified to
     MkLangID with -a.  Reduced default for -a from 0.99 to 0.90 to
     permit a greater diversity of n-grams in the model; with
     sufficient data (>50MB?), this can be lowered to 0.85 or even
     0.80.
   Added Amharic (UTF-8), Armenian (UTF-8), Czech (UTF-8), Danish
     (UTF-8), Dutch (UTF-8), Finnish (UTF-8), Greek (UTF-8), Japanese
     (EUC-JP, patent texts), Mapudungun (Latin-1), Quechua (UTF-8),
     Swedish (UTF-8), and Yoruba (UTF-8) language models.
   Added Arabic (ISO-8859-6), Chinese (GB-2312 and Big5), Greek
     (ISO-8859-7) and Thai (TIS-620) language models built by
     converting the UTF-8 training data with iconv.  Added Japanese
     (Shift-JIS) model built by converting the EUC-JP training data
     with iconv.  Added Korean (UTF-8) model built by converting the
     EUC-KR training data with iconv.  Added Armenian (ArmSCII-8)
     model built by converting the UTF-8 data with iconv.

v1.00rc2 2011-08-22:
   Store language/region/encoding/source in word-list file
     (MkLangID -w) and parse them on reading so that it is no longer
     necessary to pass those four values on the command line when
     training.  Removed index_vocab.sh as it is now superfluous.
   Added bigram byte model to language identification models.  Because
     this is a much weaker model than the long ngrams, it is given
     very low weight (basically functions as a tie-breaker or when
     there are no hits on long ngrams), and the existing bigram
     character models for string scoring are retained (they are
     stronger for multi-byte character sets).
   Fixed MkLangID newline skipping to eliminate the remaining n-grams
     containing newlines when -n is specified.
   Added Albanian (Latin-1 and ASCII-16LE), Bosnian (Latin-1 and
     ASCII-16LE), Latin-script Bulgarian (ASCII and ASCII-16LE),
     Croatian (Latin-2 and ASCII-16LE), Brazilian Portugese (Latin-1
     and ASCII-16LE), German (UTF-8), Haitian Creole (UTF-8), Hausa
     (ASCII and ASCII-16LE), Hungarian (UTF-8), Italian (UTF-8),
     Indonesian (ASCII and ASCII-16LE), Korean (EUC-KR), European
     Portugese (Latin-1 and ASCII-16LE), Romanian (Latin-2 and
     ASCII-16LE), Swahili (ASCII and ASCII-16LE), Serbian (Latin-1),
     Thai (UTF-8), Turkish (Latin-5 and ASCII-16LE), and Urdu (UTF-8)
     language models to the distribution.

v1.00rc1 2011-08-16:
   Added -2 options to MkLangID to expand input bytes to 16 bits for
     "wide ASCII" without the need to actually convert the files first.
   Added -n option to MkLangID to eliminate (most) n-grams containing
     newlines as well as those starting with a tab or blank from the
     language model.
   Added optional non-default threshold to la-string -S option.
   Added index_vocab.sh script and a variety of word frequency lists.
     These lists now replace language.db in the distribution, as they
     will be used to create language.db but take up much less space in
     the archive.
   Tweaked length increments when computing n-grams in MkLangID.
     Training now uses more memory but runs in 2/3 the time.
   Fixed segfault.
   Fixed failure to weight scores when adding over the smoothing window.

v1.00beta2 2011-08-15:
   Fixed incorrect (case-folded) matching of single-char encoding names.
   Fixed segfault when unable to open language identification database.
   Eliminate duplicate language names in output.
   Added option for MkLangID to load frequency lists rather than raw
     text, in either the format in which it writes them with -w or the
     format used by the TextCat Perl script.  Also included GPLed
     frequency lists from mguesser in the distribution, along with a
     script (index_mguesser.sh) to add them to the language database.
   Added single-char encoding names 'u' (UTF-8) and 'e' (EUC) for
     compatibility with upcoming update to GNU strings.
   Added Windows-874/CP874 as aliases for TIS-620, as they are
     essentially TIS-620 plus a few punctuation marks copied from
     Win1251.  Added some additional aliases for compatibility with
     the mguesser data files, though not all of them will be exactly
     correct.

v1.00beta 2011-07-24:
   Fixed memory leak when automatically identifying character encodings.
   Fixed parsing of -e parameter to properly handle lists of more than
     two encodings.
   Added sample language model database with n-grams up to length 15
     bytes built from English, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic
     GigaWord newswire corpora and Korean Press Agency data (80-200MB
     per source).  Note that all language data uses the UTF-8 encoding
     except Korean, which is in EUC-KR.

v1.00alpha 2011-07-22:
   First public release.
   Added language identification and automatic character encoding
     identification.

v0.9:
   Fixed EUC-JP initialization.
   Added UTF-7, HZ, and Ascii85 seven-bit encodings.
   Added ShiftJIS character encoding.
   Added ISO/IEC-6937 encoding.
   Added more ISO-8859-x encodings.
   Added several Windows-125x encodings.
   Added Kamenicky, Mazovia, MIK, and IranSystem encodings.
